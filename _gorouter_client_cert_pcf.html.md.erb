To configure Gorouter behavior for handling client certificates, select one of the options in the **Router behavior for Client Certificates** field of the **Networking** configuration screen in PAS. 

* **Router does not request client certificates.** This option is incompatible with the XFCC configuration options **TLS terminated for the first time at HAProxy** and **TLS terminated for the first time at the Router** in PAS because these options require mutual authentication. As client certificates are not requested, client will not provide them, and thus validation of client certificates will not occur.

* **Router requests but does not require client certificates.** The Gorouter requests client certificates in TLS handshakes, validates them when presented, but does not require them. This is the default configuration.

* **Router requires client certificates.** The Gorouter validates that the client certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority that the Gorouter trusts. If the Gorouter cannot validate the client certificate, the TLS handshake fails. Select this option if your load balancer terminates TLS and does not require client certificates, and the load balancer provides a compatible client certificate of its own to Gorouter in an independent TLS handshake. This option may also be selected for Isolation Segments when Gorouter is the first point of TLS termination. Many clients of CF platform APIs do not present client certificates in TLS handshakes, so the first point of TLS termination for requests to the system domain must not require them.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Requests to the platform will fail upon upgrade if your load balancer is configured to present a client certificate in the TLS handshake with Gorouter but Gorouter has not been configured with the certificate authority used to sign it. To mitigate this issue, select <strong>Router does not request client certificates</strong> for <strong>Router behavior for Client Certificate Validation</strong> in the <strong>Networking</strong> pane.</p>
