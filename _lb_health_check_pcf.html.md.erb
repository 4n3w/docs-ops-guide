Elastic Runtime uses the following properties:
	
* **Unhealthy Threshold**: Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that the Router will continue to accept connections before shutting down. During this period the healthcheck will report unhealthy to cause load balancers to fail over to other Routers. This value should be greater than or equal to the max time it could take your load balancer to consider a Router instance unhealthy, given contiguous failed healthchecks.

* **Healthy Threshold**: Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait until declaring the router instance started. This allows an external load balancer time to register the instance as healthy.

These properties are available from the **Settings** > **Network** tab.
