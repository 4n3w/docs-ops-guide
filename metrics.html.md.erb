title: Key Metrics for Monitoring a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Deployment
---

The Pivotal Cloud Ops team monitors the health of its Cloud Foundry deployments using Datadog. [This repository](./https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/datadog-config-oss) contains the customized configuration of Datadog for monitoring production and staging in a CF deployment.

This topic describes the metrics included in the custom-configured Datadog dashboard, and how the Pivotal Cloud Ops team uses them to monitor a PCF deployment.

## <a id='bosh-health'></a>BOSH Health Monitor

<%= image_tag 'metrics/bosh_health_combined.png'%>

### What we monitor 

Health, broken down by component:

- Backend:
	- NATS
	- Doppler
	- Stats
	- HM9000
	- BOSH
	- NAT Box
	- ETCD
- Frontend:
	- Router
	- DEA
	- API
	- UAA

### Why we monitor it

Each row displays the average percentage of "healthy" instances for the relevant component over the last 5 minutes and 24 hours.

For example, suppose your GoRouter has ten instance. If one is not healthy, the stoplight turns red and shows %90.


### The system metric behind it

`[bosh.healthmonitor.system.healthy]`


### Alerts

NEED MORE INFO

### Other things to know

Because BOSH restores systems very quickly when they go down, we send alerts generated from this metric to a buffer queue in our alerting system (Pagerduty) that waits two minutes before it sends an alert to the operator. We do this because BOSH/CF restores service reliably enough so that we don't need to be notified in real time for transitory restarts.


## <a id='req-per-sec'></a>Requests per second

<%= image_tag 'metrics/req_per_sec.png'%>

### What we monitor 

Requests per second for each Frontend component:
- Router
- DEA
- API
- UAA


### Why we monitor it

To track the basic flow of traffic through the components in the system.

### The system metric behind it

`cf.collector.router.requests(component: app/cloudcontroller/uaa, deployment: production)`

### Alerts

None

### Other things to know

None
