This topic explains how to integrate Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) with PCF.

##<a id="scenario-one-overview"></a>Configure Ops Manager Access

The step-by-step Ops Manager Access Workflow is explained below:

1. Users navigate to the PCF Ops Manager Login Screen – typically [https://PCF-IP/uaa](https://PCF-IP/uaa) or [https://PCF-Hostname/uaa](https://PCF-Hostname/uaa).
1. PCF checks to see if the user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated the application returns a status back to the user.
1. PCF creates a SAML assertion with the Microsoft ADFS server and redirects users to the Microsoft ADFS web portal to facilitate Single sign-on (SSO).
1. Users enter their credentials at the ADFS portal login screen. These credentials are sent to the Microsoft Active Directory Server (MADS) via Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), usually Kerberos or NTLM.
1. MADS performs a user lookup and validates user credentials.
1. Active Directory returns a response to the ADFS server via IWA. Additionally, ADFS processes claim rules set up for the claims-aware application.
1. The ADFS Server sends a Security Token over TLS to the user with the requested claim rule information. Claim rules may be used to control specific access to applications and allow developers to build claim-aware applications to support Role Based Access Controls.
1. The user sends the received token with associated claim rules back to the PCF portal.
1. If the ADFS Claim Rule passes and the correct information is presented to the PCF Ops Manager portal via the SAML token the user is logged into the Portal.

###<a id="configure-ops-manager"></a>Configure Ops Manager
You can set up SAML-based access for PCF Ops Manager during the initial PCF installation or after installation. Follow the procedure below that corresponds to your use case. 
####<a id="inital-installation"></a> Setting SAML-based Access During Initial Installation
If you are setting up SAML based access for PCF Ops Manager for the first time, follow these steps:

1. From the **Welcome to Ops Manager** portal, click the **Use an Identity Provider** button.
1. Paste the ADFS Metadata URL in the top box: `https://ADFS-FEDERATION-NAME/federationmetadata/200706/federationmetadata.xml`. Replace ADFS-FEDERATION-NAME with your ADFS Federation Name. 
1. Enter your **Decryption Passphrase**. Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
1. Navigate to the following URL to obtain the XML file with information required for the ADFS setup `https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/uaa/saml/metadata` and download the required XML file.

####<a id="existing-installation"></a> Existing Installation
If you have already installed Ops Manager, follow these steps: 
    
1. From Ops Manager, expand the drop-down menu under your username in the top right corner. 
1. Click **Settings**. 
1. Select the **Authentication Method** configuration pane. 
1. Complete the following fields:
    * **Decryption Passphrase**: Enter the decryption passphrase that you created when first installing Ops Manager.
	* **SAML IDP Metadata**: Copy your IdP metadata XML. You get this XML from your IdP console. Optionally, if your IdP supports metadata URL, you can copy the metadata URL instead of the XML.
	* **SAML Admin Group**: Enter the name of the SAML group that contains all of the Ops Manager administrators.
	* **Groups Attribute**: Enter the groups attribute tag name with which you configured the SAML server.
1. Click **Setup SAML**. 
1. Return to the Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.
1. Navigate to the following URL to obtain the XML file with information required for the ADFS setup `https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/uaa/saml/metadata` and download the required XML file.

###<a id="configure-adfs-server"></a> Configure Your ADFS Server
Now that you have completed the basic set up for SSO support using SAML for PCF. Follow the steps below to complete the integration with your Active Directory Federation Server. Completing these steps allows users in the appropriate Windows AD Security Group to log in to Ops Manager.
#### Add Relying Party Trust
1. Log in to your Active Directory Federation Services server and open the **ADFS Management** application.
1. In the left pane, expand the **Trusts Relationships** directory.
1. Right click on **Relying Party Trusts** and select **Add relying party trusts…**.
1. When prompted, click **Start** to continue adding a new relying party trust.
1. Select the middle radio button **Import data for the relying party from a file**.
1. Select the file that you downloaded in the previous procedure. 
1. Click **OK** if prompted with an alert that states not all data will be imported due to ADFS support conflicts.
1. Specify a **Display Name** for the new relying party trust.
1. Click **Next** on the **Multi-Factor Authentication** configuration screen.
1. Leave **Permit all users to access this relying party** radio button selected, press **Next**.
1. Click **Next** on the **Ready to Add Trust** screen.
1. Click **Close** to complete the wizard.

#### Modify Relying Party Trust 
1. Modify the **Relying Party Trust**. Double click on the newly created **Relying Party Trust** in the right window pane.
1. Select the **Encryption** tab and click the **Remove** button to delete the encryption certificate that was imported during the **Relying Party Trust** creation.
1. Select the **Advanced** tab and change the **Secure Hash Algorithm** to SHA-1.
