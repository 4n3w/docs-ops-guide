This topic explains how to import and stage stemcells to products by using the stemcell manager introduced in Ops Manager v2.1.

For more conceptual information about floating stemcells and stemcell upgrades, see [Understanding Floating Stemcells](../customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).

![The stemcell manager shows a table with columns headed Product, Required, Deployed, and Staged as well as an Import Stemcell button and a Save Button](images/manage-stemcells.png)

## <a id="navigate"></a> Navigate to the Stemcell Management Page

![The Manage Stemcells link is floated to the right of the Installation Dashboard header](images/installation-dashboard-manage-stemcells.png)

To navigate to the stemcell manager, click **Manage Stemcells** from the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. For more information on navigating the **Installation Dashboard**, see [Understanding the Ops Manager Interface](../customizing/pcf-interface.html).

## <a id="import"></a> Import a Stemcell

![The Import Stemcell button is floated to the right of the Manage Stemcells header next to the Save button](import-stemcell.png)

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Before you can import a stemcell, download the appropriate <code>.tgz</code> stemcell file from <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Network</a>.</p>

Clicking **Import Stemcell** prompts you to select a stemcell file to import. You can find the **Import Stemcell** button both above the stemcell management table and in the **Staged** column if no compatible stemcell is imported. Both buttons have the same functionality.

Once you import a stemcell, the stemcell is permanently in Ops Manager. If no products are compatible with the stemcell, an option to stage that stemcell appears if you later import a compatible product.

## <a id="version"></a> Choose a Stemcell Version

If you have uploaded multiple versions of a stemcell, you can use the dropdown menu in the **Staged** column to choose which version to use.

You can choose a different version until you deploy. After deployment, different stemcell versions will no longer be available.

If the stemcell has a green checkmark and the words "Latest stemcell" below the **Staged** dropdown, the stemcell is the latest available version on your host. An outdated stemcell will display "Stemcell out-of-date."

![Beneath the "Staged" version dropdown, a green checkmark next to the words "Latest stemcell" appears. The stemcell in this image is the latest available version.](opsman-latest-stemcell.png)

## <a id="stage"></a> Stage a Stemcell

![A modal that appears after importing a stemcell. The modal says, 'Select the products you want to stage'. The modal has a checkbox next to the product name. It also has a dismiss button and an Apply Stemcell to Products button](staging-modal.png)

After you import a stemcell, enable the products you want to stage your stemcell. All products are enabled by default.

Clicking **Dismiss** disables all compatible products from staging. The imported stemcell is available for selection in the **Staged** dropdown.

Clicking **Apply Stemcell to Products** stages your selections.
