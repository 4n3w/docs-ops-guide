This topic explains how to import and stage stemcells to products by using the stemcell manager introduced in Ops Manager v2.1.

For more conceptual information about floating stemcells and stemcell upgrades, see [Understanding Floating Stemcells](../customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).

![The stemcell manager shows a table with columns headed Product, Required, Deployed, and Staged as well as an Import Stemcell button and a Save Button](images/manage-stemcells.png)

## <a id="navigate"></a> Navigate to the Stemcell Management Page

![The Manage Stemcells link is floated to the right of the Installation Dashboard header](images/installation-dashboard-manage-stemcells.png)

To navigate to the stemcell manager, click **Manage Stemcells** from the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. For more information on navigating the **Installation Dashboard**, see [Understanding the Ops Manager Interface](../customizing/pcf-interface.html).

## <a id="import"></a> Import and Stage a Stemcell

![The Import Stemcell button is floated to the right of the Manage Stemcells header next to the Save button](import-stemcell.png)

Download the appropriate <code>.tgz</code> stemcell file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf). Then click **Import Stemcell** to permanently import a stemcell into Ops Manager.

![A modal that appears after importing a stemcell. The modal says, 'Select the products you want to stage'. The modal has a checkbox next to the product name. It also has a dismiss button and an Apply Stemcell to Products button](staging-modal.png)

To stage your stemcell to compatible products, enable the products in the "Import Stemcell" dialog. Click **Apply Stemcell to Products** to save your selections. Click **Dismiss** to dismiss the "Import Stemcell" dialog.

## <a id="version"></a> Choose a Stemcell Version

If you have uploaded multiple versions of a stemcell, you can use the dropdown menu in the **Staged** column to choose which version to use.

You can choose a different version until you deploy. After deployment, different stemcell versions will no longer be available.

If the stemcell has a green checkmark and the words "Latest stemcell" below the **Staged** dropdown, the stemcell is the latest available version on your host. An outdated stemcell will display "Stemcell out-of-date."
