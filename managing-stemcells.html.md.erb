The Stemcell Library was introduced in Ops Manager v2.1 to import and stage stemcells to products. Centralized stemcell management is not a feature of older versions of the Ops Manager.

For more information about the Stemcell Library, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).
