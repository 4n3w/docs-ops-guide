This topic explains how to import and stage stemcells to products by using the stemcell management page introduced in Ops Manager v2.1.

For more conceptual information about floating stemcells and stemcell upgrades, see [Understanding Floating Stemcells](../customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).

To navigate to the stemcell management page, click **Manage Stemcells** from the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. For more information on navigating the **Installation Dashboard**, see [Understanding the Ops Manager Interface](../customizing/pcf-interface.html).

## <a id="import"></a> Import a Stemcell

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Before you can import a stemcell, download the appropriate <code>.tgz</code> stemcell file from <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Network</a>.</p>

Clicking **Import Stemcell** will prompt you to select a stemcell file to import. You can find the **Import Stemcell** button both above the stemcell management table and in the **Staged** column if no compatible stemcell is imported. Both buttons have the same functionality.

Once you import a stemcell, the stemcell is permanently in Ops Manager. If no products are compatible with the stemcell, an option to stage that stemcell will appear if you later import a compatible product.

## <a id="stage"></a> Stage a Stemcell

After you import a stemcell, you will be prompted to enable the products you want to stage your stemcell. All products will be enabled by default. Disable or enable **Product** to disable or enable all products. You can also enable or disable each product individually.

Clicking **Dismiss** disables all compatible products from staging. The stemcell will still be imported and available for selection in the **Staged** dropdown.

Clicking **Apply Stemcell to Products** stages your selections.
