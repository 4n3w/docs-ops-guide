title: Using Docker Trusted Registries

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure your Docker Trusted Registries with Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF). 
To use private registries, you must choose either to submit your root certificate authority (CA) certificate 
or provide the IP address for your private Docker Trusted Registry. 

**Prerequisite**: Ensure that you have enabled Docker support in PCF with the `$ cf enable-feature-flag diego_docker` command, as described in the [Using Docker in Cloud Foundry](../concepts/docker.html) topic.

## <a id='ops-man'></a> Using a CA Certificate

If you provide your root CA certificate in the Ops Manager configuration, follow this procedure:

1. In the **PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**, click the **Ops Manager Director** tile.

1. Click **Security**. 

    <%= image_tag("images/docker-registry-ops-man.png") %>

1. In the **Trusted Certificates** field paste one or more root CA certificates.
The Docker Trusted Registry does not use the CA certificate itself but uses a certificate that is signed by the CA certificate. 

1. Click **Save**.

1. If you are:
  - Configuring Ops Manager Installation for the first time, return to your specific IAAS configuration to continue the installation process.
  - Modifying an existing Ops Manager installation, return to the **PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard** and click **Apply Changes**.

After configuration, BOSH propagates this CA certificate to all application containers in your deployment. You are then able to push and pull images from your Docker Trusted Registries.

## <a id='ert'></a> Using an IP Address Whitelist

If you choose not to provide a CA certificate, you must provide the IP address of your trusted Docker registry:

1. Navigate to the PCF Operations Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click the **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** tile, and navigate to the **Application Containers** tab. 

	<%= image_tag("images/docker-registry-ert.png") %>

1. Select **Enable Custom Buildpacks** to enable custom-built application runtime buildpacks.

1. Select **Allow SSH access to app containers** to enable app containers to accept SSH connections. If you are using a load balancer instead of HAProxy, you must open port 2222 on your load balancer to enable SSH traffic. In order to open an SSH connection to an app, a user must have Space Developer privileges for that app's space. Operators can grant those privileges in Apps Manager or via the cf CLI. 

1. For **Private Docker Insecure Registry Whitelist**, provide the hostname/IP address and port that point to your Docker Registry. For example, enter `127.32.21.1:80` or `mydockerregistry.com:80`. Enter multiple entries in a comma-delimited sequence. SSL validation will be ignored for private Docker image registries secured with self-signed certificates at these locations. 

1. Under **Docker Images Disk-Cleanup Scheduling on Cell VMs**, choose one of the following:
	* **Never Cleanup Cell Disk-space**
	* **Routinely Cleanup Cell Disk-space**
	* **Cleanup disk-space once threshold is reached**: If you choose this option, enter the amount of disk space the Cell must reach before disk cleanup initiates under **Threshold of Disk-Used (MB)**. 

1. Click **Save**. 

1. If you are: 
	- Configuring Elastic Runtime for the first time, return to your specific IaaS configuration to continue the installation process.
	- Modifying an existing Elastic Runtime installation, return to the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.

After configuration, Elastic Runtime allows Docker images to come through the specified IP address without checking certificates.
