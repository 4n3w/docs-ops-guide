<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure Disk-Cleanup scheduling
on Diego Cell Virtual Machines (VMs)
in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id='what'></a> What is Disk-Cleanup

PCF isolates application instances (AIs) from each other
using containers that run inside Cells.
Containers enforce a set of isolation layers
including file system isolation.
A PCF container file system can either be
a PCF stack
or the result of pulling a Docker image.

For performance reasons,
the Cells cache the Docker image layers and the PCF stacks
that running AIs use.
When PCF destroys an AI (e.g.: as a result of `cf delete`)
or when PCF reschedules an AI to a different Cell,
there is a chance that certain Docker image layers,
or an old PCF stack
will become unused.
If PCF does not clean these unused layers
the Cell ephemeral Disk will slowily fill.

Disk-Cleanup is the process of removing unused layers
from the Cell Disk.
The Disk-Cleanup process will remove all unused Docker image layers
and old PCF Stacks,
regardless of their size or age.

## <a id='options'></a> Options for Disk-Cleanup

PCF provides the following options
for scheduling the Disk-Cleanup process
on Cells: 

* **Never clean up the Cell Disk**:
  Pivotal does not recommend using this option
  for production environments.
* **Routinely clean up the Cell Disk**:
  This option makes the Cell schedule a Disk-Cleanup
  every time a container gets created.
  Running the Disk-Cleanup process so frequently
  may have a negative impact on the Cell performance.
* **Clean up Disk space once a threshold is reached**:
  Choosing this option makes the Cell schedule the Disk-Cleanup process
  only when a configurable Disk space threshold is reached or exceeded.

### <a id='recommendations'></a> Recommendations

Choosing the best option for Disk-Cleanup depends
on the workload that the Cells run:
Docker images or buildpack-based apps.

For PCF installations that mainly run **buildpack-based applications**
we recommend using the second option:
**Routinely clean up Cell Disk space**. 
The **Routinely clean up Cell Disk space** option ensures
that when a new stack becomes available on a Cell,
the old stack is dropped immediately from the cache.

For PCF installations that mainly run **Docker images**,
or both Docker images and buildpack-based apps,
we recommend using the third option:
**Clean up Disk space once a threshold is reached**
along with a reasonable threshold.
Choosing a threshold is described in
[Choosing a Threshold](#choosing-a-threshold).

### <a id='choosing-a-threshold'></a> Choosing a Threshold

To choose a realistic value when configuring the Disk-Cleanup threshold,
you must identify some of the most frequently used Docker images
in your PCF installation.
Docker images tend to be constructed
by creating layers over existing, base, images.
In some cases, you may find it easier
to identify which base Docker images are most frequently used.  

Follow the steps below to configure the Disk-Cleanup threshold:

1. Identify the most frequently used Docker images or base Docker images. 
<br><br>Example: The most frequently used images in a test deployment are `openjdk:7`, `nginx:1.13`, and `php:7-apache`.

1. Using the Docker CLI, measure the size of those images.
<br><br>
Example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    \# Pull identified images locally
    $> docker pull openjdk:7
    $> docker pull nginx:1.13
    $> docker pull php:7-apache

    \# Measure their sizes
    $> docker images
    REPOSITORY       TAG          IMAGE ID          CREATED             SIZE
    php              7-apache     2720c02fc079      2 days ago          391 MB
    openjdk          7            f45207c01009      5 days ago          586 MB
    nginx            1.13         3448f27c273f      5 days ago          109 MB
    ...
    </pre>

1. Calculate the threshold as the sum of the frequently used image sizes plus a reasonable buffer such as 15-20%.
<br><br>
Example: Using the output above, the sample threshold calculation is (&nbsp;391&nbsp;MB&nbsp;+&nbsp;586&nbsp;MB&nbsp;+&nbsp;109&nbsp;MB&nbsp;)&nbsp;*&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1303.2&nbsp;MB

## <a id='applying-configuration'></a> Applying the Disk-Cleanup Scheduling confiuration

1. To configure this threshold amount,
  navigate to the PCF Operations Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click the **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** tile,
  and navigate to the **Application Containers** tab.

<%= image_tag("images/docker-registry-ert.png") %>

1. Under **Docker Images Disk-Cleanup Scheduling on Cell VMs**,
  select the option that you prefer.

1. If you select the **Clean up Disk space once threshold is reached** option,
  fill in the **Threshold of Disk Used (MB)** field.
  You will need to enter the Disk space threshold amount, in MB,
  that you calculated for your deployment
  as described in [Choosing a Threshold](#choosing-a-threshold).

  <br><br>
  Example: As calculated in the previous step,
  you would enter **1303**.

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="next"></a> Next Steps

If you are configuring Elastic Runtime for the first time,
then return to your specific IaaS configuration
to continue the installation process.

If you are modifying an existing Elastic Runtime installation, 
eturn to the **PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**
and click **Apply Changes**.
