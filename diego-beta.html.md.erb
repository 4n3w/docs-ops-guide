This topic describes how to install Diego and .Net beta releases.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: This is an beta release. It is intended for demonstration purposes for customers. There are no guarantees on being able to upgrade to subsequent General Availability releases. Pivotal does not recommend running Diego beta in production.</p>

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview ##

You can use the **Diego for PCF** beta tile to deploy Diego alongside your **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** tile. This allows you to test the new Diego functionality with your installation. This includes support for .Net and Docker.

Application developers can choose to deploy their application either to the existing Elastic Runtime or to Diego beta.
