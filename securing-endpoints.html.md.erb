title: Securing System and Application Endpoints
---

This topic describes how to create a public-facing website and an intranet microservice in the same app.

The configuration described in this topic may be ideal for those in financial or health sectors who need extra security and convenience managing internal and external services. If the configuration is successful, developers can only `cf push` from approved network paths.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before beginning your configuration, you will need to have registered three domains through your trusted DNS provider:

- A **System Domain** for Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and its accompanying tile services

- An **Apps Domain** for your intranet microservice

- An **Additional Domain** for the public-facing portions of your app

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name but different subdomain names for your system and app domains. Doing so allows you to use a single wildcard certificate for the domain while preventing apps from creating routes that overlap with system routes.</p>

## <a id="system-domain"></a> Step 1: Configure System and Apps Domains

1. Log in to your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Ops Manager

1. Click the **Pivotal Application Service** tile.

1. Navigate to your DNS provider to create A records that point from your apps domains to the public IP address of your load balancer. 

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select the **Networking** pane.

For added security, you may want to install an authentication service to your private domain like Single Sign-on (SSO). For more information about SSO, see [Single Sign-On Overview](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/index.html).
