title: Identifying Elastic Runtime Jobs Using vCenter
---

To effectively monitor, control, and manage the virtual machines making up your
Elastic Runtime deployment, you may need to identify which VM corresponds to a
particular job in Elastic Runtime.
You can find the CID of a particular VM from Pivotal CF Ops Manager by
navigating to **Elastic Runtime > Status**.

If you have deployed Elastic Runtime to VMware vSphere, you can also identify
which Elastic Runtime job corresponds to which VM using the vCenter vSphere
client.
This option is not available of you have deployed Elastic Runtime to VMware
vCloud Air / vCloud.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The CID shown in Ops Manager is the name of the machine in vCenter.</p>
