<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

To help troubleshoot applications hosted by a deployment, [Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) supports SSH access into running applications. This document describes how to configure a PCF deployment to allow SSH access to application instances, and how to configure load balancing for those application SSH sessions.

## <a id='diego-configuration'></a> Pivotal Application Service Configuration

This section describes how to configure Pivotal Application Service (PAS) to enable or disable deployment-wide SSH access to application instances. In addition to this deployment-wide configuration, Space Managers have SSH access control over their Space, and Space Developers have SSH access control over their to their Applications. For details about SSH access permissions, see the [Application SSH Overview](../devguide/deploy-apps/app-ssh-overview.html) topic.

To configure PAS SSH access for application instances:

1. Open the PAS tile in Ops Manager.

1. Under the **Settings** tab, select the **Application Containers** section.

1. Enable or disable the <strong>Allow SSH access to app containers</strong> checkbox.

1. Optionally, select **Enable SSH when an app is created** to enable SSH access for new apps by default in spaces that allow SSH. If you deselect this checkbox, developers can still enable SSH after pushing their apps by running `cf enable-ssh APP-NAME`.

## <a id="ssh-load-balancer-configuration"></a> SSH Load Balancer Configuration

For IAASes where load-balancing is available as a service, the deployment operator should provision a load balancer to balance load across the SSH proxy instances. You should configure this load balancer to forward incoming TCP traffic on port 2222 to a target pool where you'll deploy your diego_brain instances.

To register the SSH proxies with this load balancer, under "Resource Config" fill in the load balancer column for the "Diego Brain" row with the name of that load balancer.
