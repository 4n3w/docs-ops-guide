The diagram below shows the key [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) Elastic Runtime network components.

# <a id='lb'></a>Load Balancer #

The load balancer is primarily used for SSL termination.
If you do not want to manage your own SSL certificates or you do not have
multiple certificates you want to use with Elastic Runtime, use the HAProxy
component to provide SSL access to your PaaS.
You also might want to omit HAProxy in favor of dedicated load balancing
hardware that facilitates SSL termination.

To omit HAProxy, set the number of instances to zero in Ops Manager.

Refer to the [Configuring PCF SSL Termination](ssl-term.html) topic for
more information.

# <a id='router'></a>Router #

Routers manage HTTP and HTTPS traffic between web clients and application
instances.
In conjunction with the Cloud Controller, routers map application URLs to the
corresponding application instances, distributing load between multiple
instances as required.

Routers are designed to be horizontally scalable.
If you have multiple routers, the load balancer distributes incoming traffic
across these routers.

topic for more information about Cloud Foundry components.
